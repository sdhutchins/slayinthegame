Welcome to Slayin' the Game! I'm Maven, a computational biologist by day and basketball fanatic by night. This blog is my space to share thoughts and observations about the game I love while focusing on both the NBA and WNBA (with some women's college basketball sprinkled in).

## What to Expect

While I won't be primarily focusing on in-depth statistical analyses or complex film breakdowns that you might find from excellent analysts like [Nekias Duncan](https://x.com/NekiasNBA) or [Mike Prada](https://x.com/mikepradanba), I hope to provide thoughtful observations and fair critiques of both men's and women's basketball. My goal is to:

- Discuss key storylines and player developments
- Discuss some higher-level stats (lineups, on/off, etc.)
- Share insights from watching games
- Celebrate the growth of women's basketball
- Connect the dots between the NBA and WNBA

## My Approach

As someone with a background in data analysis, I appreciate the analytical side of basketball, but I also love the human elements of the game. You'll find a mix of:

- Game observations and takeaways
- Player spotlights and development tracking
- Team dynamics and chemistry
- The intersection of analytics and eye test
- The unique aspects that make both leagues special

## What's Coming This Summer

I'll be covering:

- WNBA season storylines and developments
- NBA season, playoff race and postseason analysis
- Rookie development and impact
- Team transformations and chemistry
- Trades and free agent signings
- The evolution of the game

## Join the Conversation

This is meant to be a space for thoughtful basketball discussion. I welcome different perspectives and insights from fellow fans. Whether you're a die-hard WNBA fan, NBA enthusiast, or love both leagues, there's a place for you here.
