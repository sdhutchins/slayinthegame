Tonight's Sky vs Sparks game will be the last that Kamilla Cardoso plays before fulfilling <a href="https://fansided.com/nba/angel-reese-sky-players-kamilla-cardoso-americup">national team duties</a> with Brazil at the 2025 FIBA Women's AmeriCup.

Her absence (while temporary) creates a valuable window for the Sky to experiment. Ariel Atkins, Angel Reese, and Cardoso have formed a reliable core when on the floor together. With Cardoso gone, the question becomes: who fits best around that core when she returns?

This stretch is a chance to stress-test options and build cohesion around players like Michaela Onyenwere, who's quietly become the fourth piece of that core. She defends, rebounds, and doesn't require the ball to make an impact. Her athleticism and ability to guard multiple positions give the Sky flexibility they badly need.

That leaves Tyler Marsh with a critical decision: Rebecca Allen, Rachel Banham, or Hailey Van Lith as the fifth starter.

Below I dive into the data and discuss what lineups might help the Sky find some stability during this stretch and what could carry over when Cardoso returns.

## The Sky's Core: Atkins + Reese + Cardoso  

The athletic and versatile trio of Atkins, Reese, and Cardoso anchor many of the Sky's lineups, and we can imagine that this fits the vision Sky GM Jeff Pagliocca imagined.

Atkins and Reese offer versatility on both ends as secondary initiators and switchable defenders. Atkins ranks 5th in the WNBA in steals per game (1.9), and Reese ranks 10th (1.6) while also leading the league in offensive rebounds (4.0 per game). These two are anchored by the interior scoring, rim protection, rim running, and often overlooked passing of Cardoso, who is shooting 54.7% from the field (3rd in the WNBA) and averaging 1.6 assists per game.

With the core three established, the next question becomes: who plays best alongside them?

## Onyenwere Is Earning a Permanent Spot  

Michaela Onyenwere has quietly emerged as a core rotation player. Her value doesn't come from volume scoring or flashy box scores, but from doing the small things like defending multiple positions, rebounding, and making herself available without needing plays run for her. She's been the connective piece in many of the team's better lineups.

When the trio of Atkins, Reese, and Cardoso is paired with Onyenwere and Van Lith, the lineup posts a +19.2 NetRtg in 14 minutes. Swapping in Banham for HVL raises that to +22.5 NetRtg in 13 minutes. But when that same core is surrounded by Allen and Nurse, the group drops to –28.0 across 37 minutes. These are small samples, but the drop-off is hard to ignore.

The four-player lineups back this up as well. When Onyenwere joins Elizabeth Williams, Banham, and HVL, the group sits at –5.1 NetRtg across 40 minutes. It's not necessarily a "good" number, but it is better than most other combinations. Quartets built around Allen or Nurse struggle to generate efficient offense.

It's becoming harder to imagine the best version of the Sky's starting five without Onyenwere in it. She makes lineups more athletic, more cohesive, and more versatile.

## Choosing the 5th Core Player: Allen vs Banham vs HVL  

If Marsh adds Onyenwere to the starting group, the final question becomes: who fits best alongside her, Cardoso, Reese, and Atkins?

I previously mentioned how Banham and HVL, when paired with Onyenwere, have each anchored one of the Sky's most productive lineups. The Banham version leads with a +22.5 NetRtg. The HVL lineup is close behind at +19.2 and offers more pace and better ball movement. Both guards add more structure and tempo to the offense, especially when Onyenwere is on the floor doing the dirty work and defending across positions.

Allen's fit is trickier. When she joins Reese, Atkins, Banham, and Williams, the group posts a –0.3 NetRtg across 20 minutes which is not dominant, but better than most Sky 5 player lineups. When paired with Cardoso instead of Williams, however, the numbers are worse. For example, the Allen–Atkins–Nurse–Cardoso–Reese lineup has a –28.0 NetRtg in 37 minutes, struggling defensively (118.3 DefRtg). However, when Banham replaces Kia Nurse, that group improves to a –11.6 NetRtg in 25 minutes.

The difference points to a clear trend: Allen thrives with more structure around her. She's most effective when surrounded by multiple ball handlers like Banham with Atkins and a mobile big who can cover space and rebound. The Sky need her size, length, and spacing, but she can't be expected to help organize the offense.

With Cardoso out, this Sky should consider starting the Allen–Williams–Banham–Atkins–Reese lineup. That combination has shown signs of being productive, and Onyenwere could be shifted to the four to start instead with Williams coming off the bench as the backup five. Either approach keeps the Sky balanced on both ends while avoiding the lowest-performing lineups seen so far.

## Looking Forward  

So how can the Sky use Cardoso's absence to test what really works?

The Sky must lean into lineups that establish the team's identity. That starts with trusting Onyenwere more. It likely means giving more minutes to Banham or HVL. Also, it means avoiding lineups without any shot creators.

This stretch is a chance to lock in combinations that can carry over when Cardoso returns. What the Sky learn now could help them start building something sustainable.
