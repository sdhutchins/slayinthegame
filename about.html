<p>Hi, I'm Maven (<a href="https://x.com/slayinmaven">@slayinmaven</a> on <i class="fab fa-x-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>), a PhD student in computational biology. When I'm not analyzing biological data, you'll find me deep in basketball analytics and game discussions.</p>

<p>This blog is my space to share my thoughts and analysis about the NBA and WNBA. I combine my analytical background with my passion for basketball to break down games, player performances, and the fascinating stats that tell the story of basketball.</p>

<p class="mb-5">Whether you're here for the WNBA's rising stars, the NBA's latest trends, or just great basketball discussion, you're in the right place. Let's talk hoops!</p>
